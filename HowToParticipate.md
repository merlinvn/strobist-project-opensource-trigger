# How can I get involved? #

  * Join the associated [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/spot-development)
  * Build a pair of SPOTs (take pictures of the process!)
  * Tell us what you learned

# Some ideas for improving the SPOT #

  * Simplify the case!!
  * Design a PCB (perhaps look at roadmap for Version 2 first, the hardware will change)
  * Adopt this to the devices you need it for (flashes, cameras) and tell us how you did it!
  * Enhance the trivial (fixed) packet "checksum" (e.g. Hamming 8-4??)
  * Write real-world experience reports (based on the devices _**you**_ built) and spread the word
  * Design a project logo
    * Spotted animals: Dalmatian (friendly, stylish), Cheetah (fast), ...?
    * Something in a "spot" of light: Hot shoe flash, “SPOT”, ...
  * Good idea in the comments: Freemask function (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdY_4-xhRs0)
